In this project I have made a Github Repository for evaluating the performance of various hand pose estimation models.I have taken various hand pose datasets like NYU, ICVL, MSRA datasets which are freely available online.
We also have the predictive estimations of different models on these datasets.
There are two types of evaluation metrics that are widely used for hand pose estimation:

(1) Mean error for each joint

(2) Success rate:

The proportion of test frames whose average error falls below a threshold
The proportion of test frames whose maximum error falls below a threshold
The proportion of all joints whose error falls below a threshold

Hand pose estimation models are designed to predict the 3D positions or joint angles of a hand given an input image or video. These models have been widely studied and evaluated in the computer vision and robotics communities.

In this project we have used python for evaluating the models, I learned how to use various libraries like os, numpy, matplotlib, sys etc.effectively.
